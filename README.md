Inside bin have two binarys.
key_generator and one_time_pad

key_generator file

This script have only one entry that is the file the user want to ciph, this file create the file.key.

one_time_pad file file.key

This script do the one time pad with the key generated, I don't recomend do this with major importance files, if for some reason the script is interrupted , you losed with your file. This program have educational proprosal.
